Coach: Hi! Good morning, Liz. How are you today?
Client: I'm good! How are you?
Coach: I'm doing well, thank you.
Coach: Is there anything you need to do before we can get started?
Client: No, I've got everything here. Yep. Ready to go! Yes.
Coach: Okay, so tell me what's on your mind?
Client: So, I… I've been doing a lot of, things lately to… kind of…
Client: not focus on me, and also focus on, sort of, the year. And
Client: I've been sometimes putting off, like, exercise…
Client: Or things like that, that, like, at the end of the day, I'm
Client: I kind of, like… because, I know that…
Client: Moving my body and getting exercise, or, you know, doing all
Client: I have noticed, like, A bit of a drop in my energy levels
Coach: Hmm.
Coach: Yeah, I'm hearing that you are feeling guilty that you're not
Client: Like, it can be.
Coach: And your energy has dropped.
Coach: Right.
Coach: So, just curious to know, you say guilty. What makes you
Client: myself, I don't know. I think it's just, like, I set these…
Client: or expectations for myself, and then when I… don't feel I've
Client: It just makes me… feel like… Yeah.
Client: The feeling of guilt is kind of like… I should have done
Client: I'm trying to… Work on the inner.
Client: critic and… and… change that… response.
Client: So that I don't take that negative talk into the next day.
Client: Sometimes that negative talk
Client: will restrict me, even the next day, from doing it, just
Coach: Hmm, so you would like to change the response to your negative
Client: Boohoo.
Coach: Yeah.
Coach: So… With that, what would you like to have at the end of
Client: I think, maybe, like, a tool.
Client: that I can use, when…
Client: I'm having that negative self-talk,
Client: to come out of it. So…
Client: basically, like, I don't want to go two days in a row without
Client: with not having that exercise, because I know it's important.
Client: And maybe it's just…
Client: I think I would like to have… Maybe a…
Client: A different view on what exercise is.
Coach: Different view.
Coach: Just curious to know, what's your definition of a different
Coach: What's your current view?
Client: Yeah, so when I think of exercise.
Client: It's typically, like, getting to the gym, or getting my heart
Client: Yeah, like, those kinds of things, like, very structured…
Client: Yesterday, for instance, I ended up going skating, which was
Client: Which is good, but it's like…
Client: I guess maybe recognizing that that is… Like, moving my body.
Client: And not… and not feeling bad for not having…
Client: done, you know, my push-ups, or my kettlebell reps, or things
Client: Yeah.
Coach: Yeah, I'm hearing that you want to change your view in terms of
Coach: Right.
Coach: Okay, how do you know if you have it?
Client: I won't question it, or I won't feel, I'll feel content that…
Client: I've gotten through the day, and moved my body.
Client: I think it's also just, like.
Client: A reframing, in my mind, of, kind of, the story I tell
Client: At the end of the day, that…
Client: just because I didn't get to the gym, or just because I
Client: And so… Maybe giving myself a little bit more grace for…
Client: Getting myself up and moving around, and, you know, there's
Client: Or throughout the day, or whatever, that sometimes don't…
Client: Give me the time to do…
Client: To get to the gym, or… or to do the exercise, I…
Client: was planning on doing, and so…
Client: I think it's… yeah, I think it's just more… Accepting that.
Client: And then… Not bringing that into the next day.
Client: The negative side.
Coach: Yeah, I'm also hearing this negative thought that's… Is there
Coach: Okay, earlier you mentioned that energy. You're…
Coach: You said your energy dropped a little.
Coach: Personal by doing different exercises.
Coach: What do you notice?
Coach: Lututing ski.
Client: Skating? Or skiing?
Coach: Sorry, just the… just like you said, a different kind of
Client: Oh.
Coach: In terms of energy.
Coach: What do you…
Client: Yes.
Client: Yeah, I mean, I get energy from…
Client: I mean, sometimes I feel tired after exercise, but it's,
Client: I used up… Some of my energy, but, like, in a good way.
Client: So it's like a rewarding tired,
Client: I get, like, these dopamine kind of bumps, especially, like.
Client: when I get to the gym, and like, even if I do… and I think
Client: I don't… even if I get to the gym and do 10 minutes of an
Client: it's the process of getting there, and, like, actually
Client: And maybe that's it, like, I don't need to do an hour or
Client: Allotting my time more.
Client: Realistically, to fit it in. And if it's…
Client: maybe not the gym, then, like, how do I fit it into my day?
Client: can get it done. It just makes me feel better.
Client: And it's important for my health, and so… Yeah, we have… We
Client: Like, weights and stuff here at the house, so… It's
Coach: Right.
Coach: So… What's in your mind in terms of, Exercise.
Client: Can you… Say that a different way?
Coach: So, you mentioned that you can do exercise at home.
Client: Hmm.
Coach: What would you, if you do exercise at home.
Coach: What's… what's your view on that?
Client: Hmm.
Client: Yeah, I mean… it's fine. I just don't feel like… because I
Client: Maybe the… the thing that…
Client: maybe makes me feel different about it is that, like, my home
Client: So, I don't… I guess maybe it's, like, the change of scenery
Client: That is part of the, like, feeling of… The exercise. And so…
Client: Maybe it's just changing my view around, that. And…
Client: Maybe it's just doing it, like, in a different room, or,
Client: Like, putting on my exercise clothes and changing out of
Coach: Yeah, here you're trying to make a little bit of difference,
Client: That's amazing.
Coach: more.
Coach: fun.
Coach: Yeah. So what else could be possible?
Coach: to… What is required to call it an exercise that you feel like.
Client: Mmm.
Client: I think it's just, like… consciously… Acknowledging.
Client: when… I… am moving my body, like, specifically that I've
Client: And… like, acknowledging that, okay, that's… that's my time,
Client: And just like I wouldn't be at the gym, I would go, I would
Client: I think that's really what… And…
Client: Sometimes writing it down helps me, too.
Client: Because… it's like… almost like a meeting that I don't want
Client: Putting that time into my schedule.
Client: For me.
Client: is helpful.
Coach: Right.
Coach: You want to make it a task for the day that you did it.
Client: Yeah.
Coach: Right So, if you do that, what response will you give to
Client: I'm here, you didn't.
Client: We didn't.
Coach: Woohoo.
Client: And, maybe just noticing the… The feeling of…
Client: how I feel after I do it.
Client: And recognizing that and thanking myself for, you know.
Client: So, just maybe more mindful about it.
Coach: I'm here to recognize that you did it.
Client: It is exercise.
Coach: For yourself.
Client: Yeah.
Coach: Right.
Coach: Other than home exercise, what else,
Coach: Could be some alternative as exercise that fits in your
Client: I mean, walking the dogs.
Client: they need exercise, too. So, I feel good about that, because
Client: Taking care of myself and them.
Client: And we have, like, some really nice trails and stuff, so I…
Client: Right now, it's really snowy, so I have to, like, snowshoe
Client: So, but that's good exercise.
Client: And it's nice to get the fresh air, so it's change of
Client: there's different types of exercise, too. There's, like,
Client: strength training, there's… like, I've done…
Client: YouTube exercises before. I mean, we have I went skating last
Client: I'm going skiing tomorrow, so there… there are options.
Client: Where there's a lot of options for…
Client: Exercise other than the gym. Outdoor exercise.
Coach: Hmm.
Coach: Lots of good options come out.
Coach: Yeah, and… In terms of energy level.
Coach: What will give you energy?
Client: Oh, one of the things that gives me energy is, like, I like…
Client: So, you know, it's always fun to go, like, skiing, or, you
Client: hiking, or things like that with people, I… I find that
Client: sometimes just doing things on my own also gives me energy,
Client: Putting a good like, playlist on while I'm…
Client: Exercising is good, too. Music gives me energy. Yeah,
Client: Obviously, sleeping and rest also. So having a good sleep.
Client: It does help me sleep, too, when I… When I exercise.
Client: So… I mean, it'll all kind of, I guess, relates.
Client: Back.
Coach: There's so many options in your plate.
Client: to go.
Coach: And… Would you, what… in terms of what we want to achieve
Coach: So, how confident do you feel like you can push through those
Coach: That different kind of exercise that can help you.
Client: feel pretty confident. I think it's more just, like, my
Client: So it's… instead of, you know.
Client: I'm too tired, I can't do this, or I don't want to do this,
Client: if I do this, and I…
Client: all I have to do is…
Client: is start, and I don't… and even if it's, like, 5 minutes.
Client: it's at least something, rather than nothing. And then I…
Client: You know, and then I will feel better that I did it than if I
Client: didn't. So, yeah. I think it's just changing my, thought on
Coach: Right.
Coach: What could be possibly in the way?
Coach: For you to start doing exercise.
Client: Well, I mean… I do exercise pretty regularly, but I, I think,
Client: mindset on the length of time when I don't feel that I have
Client: Finding creative ways to add it into my day.
Client: That can be fun.
Coach: What tools can… Use… Like, can you use to help you?
Coach: To make sure this is happening.
Client: I can set reminders on my phone,
Client: I could put some, like, carve time out in my calendar.
Client: we leave the barbell in our kitchen. So, you know, just
Client: Not having, you know, That doesn't necessarily take a lot of
Client: So, just like… You know, making…
Client: Making different choices for myself,
Client: I think also just, like, I can put up some…
Client: Like, quotes that are kind of motivational for me as well.
Client: that… Can remind me that, okay.
Client: I know how I feel when I do this.
Client: And, it just, like… It'll just give me these little… Gentle
Coach: Yeah. Yeah, I'm hearing a lot of great insight, and thank you
Coach: I'm… So, where we're at in terms of this different view.
Client: Yeah.
Client: feeling more hopeful. I think I'm…
Client: shifted my view a little bit more on, sort of, like, the
Client: what I can do with the time that I have,
Client: And that's hopeful for me, so, like… You know, again, it's
Client: making it a priority. Even if it's a short period of time,
Client: you know.
Client: And it can be, like, throughout the day, it doesn't have to
Client: specific time, like, it can… It can be different little
Client: That I can still accomplish. So, maybe it's just, like, also
Client: Actually, that's… that's a good way.
Client: Of looking at it is, like, maybe finding, like, a routine, or
Client: for times when I don't have as much time.
Client: That I can just do at home, like, in between, or…
Client: like, in between my work, or in between whatever I'm doing,
Client: Are easy, but make me feel good.
Coach: Hmm.
Coach: Yeah, in the next couple days, what would you…
Coach: What can you take as a first step?
Client: Yeah, finding… I think I'm gonna start looking for some
Client: That don't necessarily… like, maybe, like, an app or
Client: Can help with, different exercises for… Me that can… Can work
Client: my day.
Client: Yeah.
Coach: Yeah, okay, so, well, thank you, Liz, for… for…
Coach: for share this conversation with me, and it's quite inspiring
Client: like, the stories I tell myself.
Client: And realizing the excuses that I make.
Client: that hold me back from doing something, whereas if I stopped,
Client: productive to… implement a change.
Client: So I think that that's encouraging, is…
Client: just recognizing when that happens, and what can I do to
Coach: What could be something you can think of that, if you felt like
Coach: The exercise you want to do.
Client: There's some reminder, it could be… Yeah, I think… Maybe
Client: Matt, like, hold me accountable. At the end of the day,
Client: 10 minutes a day of… of strength training. You know, what
Client: And if I haven't, then… You know, before I can…
Client: watch TV, or something like that, like, I just do that.
Client: Unless I'm sick or something, but…
Coach: Yeah.
