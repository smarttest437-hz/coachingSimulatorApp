00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:06.029
Coach: Hi! Good morning, Liz. How are you today?
2
00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:08.410
Coachee: I'm good! How are you?
3
00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:10.499
Coach: I'm doing well, thank you.
4
00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:14.719
Coach: Is there anything you need to do before we can get started?
5
00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.359
Coachee: No, I've got everything here. Yep. Ready to go! Yes.
6
00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:24.560
Coach: Okay, so tell me what's on your mind?
7
00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:39.870
Coachee: So, I… I've been doing a lot of, things lately to… kind of…
8
00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:49.520
Coachee: not focus on me, and also focus on, sort of, the year. And
I've noticed that,
9
00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:58.490
Coachee: I've been sometimes putting off, like, exercise…
10
00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:05.680
Coachee: Or things like that, that, like, at the end of the day, I'm
like, ugh, I feel guilty.
11
00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:12.080
Coachee: I kind of, like… because, I know that…
12
00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:29.099
Coachee: Moving my body and getting exercise, or, you know, doing all
those things is important, and it also helps me to just, like,
regulate myself, throughout the week, so…
13
00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:35.609
Coachee: I have noticed, like, A bit of a drop in my energy levels
because of it.
14
00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:37.870
Coach: Hmm.
15
00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:43.699
Coach: Yeah, I'm hearing that you are feeling guilty that you're not
doing exercise.
16
00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.980
Coachee: Like, it can be.
17
00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.189
Coach: And your energy has dropped.
18
00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:51.600
Coach: Right.
19
00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.750
Coach: So, just curious to know, you say guilty. What makes you
guilty?
20
00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:12.880
Coachee: myself, I don't know. I think it's just, like, I set these…
goals for myself.
21
00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:20.140
Coachee: or expectations for myself, and then when I… don't feel I've
met them.
22
00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:30.420
Coachee: It just makes me… feel like… Yeah.
23
00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.659
Coachee: The feeling of guilt is kind of like… I should have done
that.
24
00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:45.199
Coachee: I'm trying to… Work on the inner.
25
00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:52.130
Coachee: critic and… and… change that… response.
26
00:02:53.670 --> 00:03:00.770
Coachee: So that I don't take that negative talk into the next day.
27
00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:04.430
Coachee: Sometimes that negative talk
28
00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:12.840
Coachee: will restrict me, even the next day, from doing it, just
because then I'm like, Yeah.
29
00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:20.100
Coach: Hmm, so you would like to change the response to your negative
inner critic?
30
00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.010
Coachee: Boohoo.
31
00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:24.080
Coach: Yeah.
32
00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:29.380
Coach: So… With that, what would you like to have at the end of
today's session?
33
00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:46.319
Coachee: I think, maybe, like, a tool.
34
00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:53.520
Coachee: that I can use, when…
35
00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.919
Coachee: I'm having that negative self-talk,
36
00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.720
Coachee: to come out of it. So…
37
00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:09.219
Coachee: basically, like, I don't want to go two days in a row without
not…
38
00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:13.370
Coachee: with not having that exercise, because I know it's important.
39
00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:17.890
Coachee: And maybe it's just…
40
00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:25.510
Coachee: I think I would like to have… Maybe a…
41
00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:30.450
Coachee: A different view on what exercise is.
42
00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:34.300
Coach: Different view.
43
00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:41.880
Coach: Just curious to know, what's your definition of a different
view?
44
00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:43.620
Coach: What's your current view?
45
00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:47.409
Coachee: Yeah, so when I think of exercise.
46
00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:55.160
Coachee: It's typically, like, getting to the gym, or getting my heart
rate up, or,
47
00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:12.409
Coachee: Yeah, like, those kinds of things, like, very structured…
Movements. But, like…
48
00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:21.879
Coachee: Yesterday, for instance, I ended up going skating, which was
exercise.
49
00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:28.549
Coachee: Which is good, but it's like…
50
00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:35.850
Coachee: I guess maybe recognizing that that is… Like, moving my body.
51
00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:41.160
Coachee: And not… and not feeling bad for not having…
52
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:48.720
Coachee: done, you know, my push-ups, or my kettlebell reps, or things
like that.
53
00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:53.050
Coachee: Yeah.
54
00:05:54.210 --> 00:06:00.940
Coach: Yeah, I'm hearing that you want to change your view in terms of
what kind of exercise considered as exercise.
55
00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:03.540
Coach: Right.
56
00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:06.990
Coach: Okay, how do you know if you have it?
57
00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:20.859
Coachee: I won't question it, or I won't feel, I'll feel content that…
58
00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:29.240
Coachee: I've gotten through the day, and moved my body.
59
00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:32.230
Coachee: I think it's also just, like.
60
00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:40.880
Coachee: A reframing, in my mind, of, kind of, the story I tell
myself.
61
00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:45.150
Coachee: At the end of the day, that…
62
00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:58.569
Coachee: just because I didn't get to the gym, or just because I
didn't do anything, like, my dumbbells or something like that doesn't
mean that I didn't move my body.
63
00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:05.469
Coachee: And so… Maybe giving myself a little bit more grace for…
64
00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:15.010
Coachee: Getting myself up and moving around, and, you know, there's
things that happen in life
65
00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:20.230
Coachee: Or throughout the day, or whatever, that sometimes don't…
66
00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:22.990
Coachee: Give me the time to do…
67
00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:28.129
Coachee: To get to the gym, or… or to do the exercise, I…
68
00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:30.750
Coachee: was planning on doing, and so…
69
00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:39.630
Coachee: I think it's… yeah, I think it's just more… Accepting that.
70
00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:47.399
Coachee: And then… Not bringing that into the next day.
71
00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:49.570
Coachee: The negative side.
72
00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:58.699
Coach: Yeah, I'm also hearing this negative thought that's… Is there
that can… Can impact you negatively.
73
00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:06.470
Coach: Okay, earlier you mentioned that energy. You're…
74
00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:08.849
Coach: You said your energy dropped a little.
75
00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:12.440
Coach: Personal by doing different exercises.
76
00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:16.380
Coach: What do you notice?
77
00:08:17.010 --> 00:08:18.930
Coach: Lututing ski.
78
00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:22.689
Coachee: Skating? Or skiing?
79
00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:26.989
Coach: Sorry, just the… just like you said, a different kind of
exercise.
80
00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:27.540
Coachee: Oh.
81
00:08:28.250 --> 00:08:29.780
Coach: In terms of energy.
82
00:08:29.890 --> 00:08:30.440
Coach: What do you…
83
00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:31.300
Coachee: Yes.
84
00:08:34.710 --> 00:08:37.660
Coachee: Yeah, I mean, I get energy from…
85
00:08:38.530 --> 00:08:46.410
Coachee: I mean, sometimes I feel tired after exercise, but it's,
like, a good tired. It's like, oh, okay, like…
86
00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:52.259
Coachee: I used up… Some of my energy, but, like, in a good way.
87
00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:56.650
Coachee: So it's like a rewarding tired,
88
00:08:58.420 --> 00:09:03.900
Coachee: I get, like, these dopamine kind of bumps, especially, like.
89
00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:10.789
Coachee: when I get to the gym, and like, even if I do… and I think
that's the other thing, is that…
90
00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:17.839
Coachee: I don't… even if I get to the gym and do 10 minutes of an
exercise, it's… it's the…
91
00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:25.850
Coachee: it's the process of getting there, and, like, actually
physically doing it. And, you know,
92
00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:32.889
Coachee: And maybe that's it, like, I don't need to do an hour or
more. It's like…
93
00:09:33.610 --> 00:09:35.700
Coachee: Allotting my time more.
94
00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:42.459
Coachee: Realistically, to fit it in. And if it's…
95
00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:52.030
Coachee: maybe not the gym, then, like, how do I fit it into my day?
So, you know, carving out time within my day so that I…
96
00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:57.010
Coachee: can get it done. It just makes me feel better.
97
00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:07.060
Coachee: And it's important for my health, and so… Yeah, we have… We
do have stuff.
98
00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:15.660
Coachee: Like, weights and stuff here at the house, so… It's
manageable. It's doable.
99
00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:17.690
Coach: Right.
100
00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:25.909
Coach: So… What's in your mind in terms of, Exercise.
101
00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:35.280
Coachee: Can you… Say that a different way?
102
00:10:36.510 --> 00:10:40.140
Coach: So, you mentioned that you can do exercise at home.
103
00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:40.820
Coachee: Hmm.
104
00:10:42.430 --> 00:10:45.939
Coach: What would you, if you do exercise at home.
105
00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:48.690
Coach: What's… what's your view on that?
106
00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:49.370
Coachee: Hmm.
107
00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:59.900
Coachee: Yeah, I mean… it's fine. I just don't feel like… because I
think, really, we're…
108
00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:02.260
Coachee: Maybe the… the thing that…
109
00:11:03.250 --> 00:11:12.659
Coachee: maybe makes me feel different about it is that, like, my home
is where I live, my home is where I work, and my home is where, you
know.
110
00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:18.669
Coachee: So, I don't… I guess maybe it's, like, the change of scenery
for me?
111
00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:28.920
Coachee: That is part of the, like, feeling of… The exercise. And so…
112
00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:37.160
Coachee: Maybe it's just changing my view around, that. And…
113
00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:43.000
Coachee: Maybe it's just doing it, like, in a different room, or,
114
00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:53.880
Coachee: Like, putting on my exercise clothes and changing out of
them, you know, just, like, maybe just changing the ritual of it.
115
00:11:55.150 --> 00:11:59.240
Coach: Yeah, here you're trying to make a little bit of difference,
that's why.
116
00:11:59.240 --> 00:11:59.899
Coachee: That's amazing.
117
00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:00.650
Coach: more.
118
00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:02.300
Coach: fun.
119
00:12:03.030 --> 00:12:06.689
Coach: Yeah. So what else could be possible?
120
00:12:07.590 --> 00:12:15.310
Coach: to… What is required to call it an exercise that you feel like.
121
00:12:15.310 --> 00:12:16.010
Coachee: Mmm.
122
00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:27.430
Coachee: I think it's just, like… consciously… Acknowledging.
123
00:12:28.030 --> 00:12:41.040
Coachee: when… I… am moving my body, like, specifically that I've
carved out time, like, let's say 10 minutes,
124
00:12:43.650 --> 00:12:52.039
Coachee: And… like, acknowledging that, okay, that's… that's my time,
I'm not going to be distracted.
125
00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:59.570
Coachee: And just like I wouldn't be at the gym, I would go, I would
do what I do, so it's…
126
00:13:00.050 --> 00:13:06.820
Coachee: I think that's really what… And…
127
00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:09.869
Coachee: Sometimes writing it down helps me, too.
128
00:13:09.970 --> 00:13:16.460
Coachee: Because… it's like… almost like a meeting that I don't want
to miss, and so…
129
00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:19.600
Coachee: Putting that time into my schedule.
130
00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:22.800
Coachee: For me.
131
00:13:23.540 --> 00:13:24.720
Coachee: is helpful.
132
00:13:25.570 --> 00:13:26.110
Coach: Right.
133
00:13:26.690 --> 00:13:30.520
Coach: You want to make it a task for the day that you did it.
134
00:13:32.190 --> 00:13:33.010
Coachee: Yeah.
135
00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:40.600
Coach: Right So, if you do that, what response will you give to
yourself?
136
00:13:51.290 --> 00:13:53.489
Coachee: I'm here, you didn't.
137
00:13:54.010 --> 00:13:55.260
Coachee: We didn't.
138
00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:56.480
Coach: Woohoo.
139
00:13:56.670 --> 00:14:09.389
Coachee: And, maybe just noticing the… The feeling of…
140
00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:12.509
Coachee: how I feel after I do it.
141
00:14:12.850 --> 00:14:16.730
Coachee: And recognizing that and thanking myself for, you know.
142
00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:20.459
Coachee: So, just maybe more mindful about it.
143
00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:25.930
Coach: I'm here to recognize that you did it.
144
00:14:25.930 --> 00:14:27.380
Coachee: It is exercise.
145
00:14:27.570 --> 00:14:28.230
Coach: For yourself.
146
00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:30.610
Coachee: Yeah.
147
00:14:32.030 --> 00:14:32.640
Coach: Right.
148
00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:36.589
Coach: Other than home exercise, what else,
149
00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:41.710
Coach: Could be some alternative as exercise that fits in your
schedule.
150
00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:47.160
Coachee: I mean, walking the dogs.
151
00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:54.309
Coachee: they need exercise, too. So, I feel good about that, because
you know, I'm…
152
00:14:55.410 --> 00:14:58.829
Coachee: Taking care of myself and them.
153
00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:04.169
Coachee: And we have, like, some really nice trails and stuff, so I…
154
00:15:04.310 --> 00:15:09.209
Coachee: Right now, it's really snowy, so I have to, like, snowshoe
through.
155
00:15:09.670 --> 00:15:12.610
Coachee: So, but that's good exercise.
156
00:15:13.250 --> 00:15:22.879
Coachee: And it's nice to get the fresh air, so it's change of
scenery. Yeah, I mean, I think…
157
00:15:23.190 --> 00:15:30.119
Coachee: there's different types of exercise, too. There's, like,
yoga, there's,
158
00:15:30.850 --> 00:15:34.380
Coachee: strength training, there's… like, I've done…
159
00:15:34.530 --> 00:15:42.679
Coachee: YouTube exercises before. I mean, we have I went skating last
night.
160
00:15:42.910 --> 00:15:49.379
Coachee: I'm going skiing tomorrow, so there… there are options.
We're… we live in a place
161
00:15:49.510 --> 00:15:52.429
Coachee: Where there's a lot of options for…
162
00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:55.980
Coachee: Exercise other than the gym. Outdoor exercise.
163
00:15:56.480 --> 00:15:57.140
Coach: Hmm.
164
00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:00.290
Coach: Lots of good options come out.
165
00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:06.250
Coach: Yeah, and… In terms of energy level.
166
00:16:07.290 --> 00:16:08.920
Coach: What will give you energy?
167
00:16:14.630 --> 00:16:22.470
Coachee: Oh, one of the things that gives me energy is, like, I like…
Doing activities with people.
168
00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:31.749
Coachee: So, you know, it's always fun to go, like, skiing, or, you
know…
169
00:16:32.170 --> 00:16:38.649
Coachee: hiking, or things like that with people, I… I find that
enjoyable.
170
00:16:39.330 --> 00:16:46.500
Coachee: sometimes just doing things on my own also gives me energy,
it just depends on how I feel. Like, I like to recharge.
171
00:16:47.210 --> 00:16:52.699
Coachee: Putting a good like, playlist on while I'm…
172
00:16:53.990 --> 00:17:01.110
Coachee: Exercising is good, too. Music gives me energy. Yeah,
there's… well…
173
00:17:01.290 --> 00:17:06.700
Coachee: Obviously, sleeping and rest also. So having a good sleep.
174
00:17:08.410 --> 00:17:13.190
Coachee: It does help me sleep, too, when I… When I exercise.
175
00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:18.490
Coachee: So… I mean, it'll all kind of, I guess, relates.
176
00:17:18.930 --> 00:17:19.670
Coachee: Back.
177
00:17:22.789 --> 00:17:25.339
Coach: There's so many options in your plate.
178
00:17:25.339 --> 00:17:25.989
Coachee: to go.
179
00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:35.459
Coach: And… Would you, what… in terms of what we want to achieve
today. So, what would you…
180
00:17:40.430 --> 00:17:45.940
Coach: So, how confident do you feel like you can push through those
exercises?
181
00:17:46.060 --> 00:17:48.630
Coach: That different kind of exercise that can help you.
182
00:17:53.120 --> 00:18:05.980
Coachee: feel pretty confident. I think it's more just, like, my
mindset, and… The story I tell myself.
183
00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:08.940
Coachee: So it's… instead of, you know.
184
00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:17.900
Coachee: I'm too tired, I can't do this, or I don't want to do this,
it's… I will feel… better.
185
00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:20.170
Coachee: if I do this, and I…
186
00:18:20.310 --> 00:18:21.969
Coachee: all I have to do is…
187
00:18:23.770 --> 00:18:28.599
Coachee: is start, and I don't… and even if it's, like, 5 minutes.
188
00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:33.510
Coachee: it's at least something, rather than nothing. And then I…
189
00:18:34.430 --> 00:18:39.860
Coachee: You know, and then I will feel better that I did it than if I
just…
190
00:18:41.490 --> 00:18:51.279
Coachee: didn't. So, yeah. I think it's just changing my, thought on
how long it takes, or how long I should be going for.
191
00:18:52.570 --> 00:18:53.180
Coach: Right.
192
00:18:53.390 --> 00:18:55.780
Coach: What could be possibly in the way?
193
00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.250
Coach: For you to start doing exercise.
194
00:19:03.770 --> 00:19:15.400
Coachee: Well, I mean… I do exercise pretty regularly, but I, I think,
again, it's just changing my…
195
00:19:17.980 --> 00:19:24.070
Coachee: mindset on the length of time when I don't feel that I have
time, so I think it's, like.
196
00:19:30.790 --> 00:19:35.360
Coachee: Finding creative ways to add it into my day.
197
00:19:36.970 --> 00:19:40.199
Coachee: That can be fun.
198
00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:50.689
Coach: What tools can… Use… Like, can you use to help you?
199
00:19:51.570 --> 00:19:53.650
Coach: To make sure this is happening.
200
00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:59.779
Coachee: I can set reminders on my phone,
201
00:20:01.530 --> 00:20:06.370
Coachee: I could put some, like, carve time out in my calendar.
202
00:20:07.290 --> 00:20:15.799
Coachee: we leave the barbell in our kitchen. So, you know, just
having things readily available,
203
00:20:16.150 --> 00:20:21.010
Coachee: Not having, you know, That doesn't necessarily take a lot of
time.
204
00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:27.140
Coachee: So, just like… You know, making…
205
00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:31.479
Coachee: Making different choices for myself,
206
00:20:33.010 --> 00:20:38.640
Coachee: I think also just, like, I can put up some…
207
00:20:40.070 --> 00:20:44.460
Coachee: Like, quotes that are kind of motivational for me as well.
208
00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:50.019
Coachee: that… Can remind me that, okay.
209
00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:52.750
Coachee: I know how I feel when I do this.
210
00:20:53.580 --> 00:21:05.690
Coachee: And, it just, like… It'll just give me these little… Gentle
nudges.
211
00:21:06.510 --> 00:21:11.869
Coach: Yeah. Yeah, I'm hearing a lot of great insight, and thank you
for sharing that with me.
212
00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:19.859
Coach: I'm… So, where we're at in terms of this different view.
213
00:21:20.460 --> 00:21:21.190
Coachee: Yeah.
214
00:21:22.590 --> 00:21:25.850
Coachee: feeling more hopeful. I think I'm…
215
00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:31.380
Coachee: shifted my view a little bit more on, sort of, like, the
possibilities of
216
00:21:31.950 --> 00:21:36.140
Coachee: what I can do with the time that I have,
217
00:21:37.220 --> 00:21:42.890
Coachee: And that's hopeful for me, so, like… You know, again, it's
like…
218
00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:53.650
Coachee: making it a priority. Even if it's a short period of time,
it's still something that's important, and making
219
00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:54.870
Coachee: you know.
220
00:21:55.500 --> 00:21:59.259
Coachee: And it can be, like, throughout the day, it doesn't have to
be in one…
221
00:21:59.870 --> 00:22:06.159
Coachee: specific time, like, it can… It can be different little
things as… as I go.
222
00:22:06.740 --> 00:22:14.620
Coachee: That I can still accomplish. So, maybe it's just, like, also
finding different exercises that I can do when I'm…
223
00:22:16.010 --> 00:22:18.170
Coachee: Actually, that's… that's a good way.
224
00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:24.910
Coachee: Of looking at it is, like, maybe finding, like, a routine, or
something, when I…
225
00:22:25.100 --> 00:22:27.690
Coachee: for times when I don't have as much time.
226
00:22:28.170 --> 00:22:32.949
Coachee: That I can just do at home, like, in between, or…
227
00:22:33.380 --> 00:22:37.889
Coachee: like, in between my work, or in between whatever I'm doing,
that…
228
00:22:38.230 --> 00:22:41.240
Coachee: Are easy, but make me feel good.
229
00:22:41.890 --> 00:22:42.600
Coach: Hmm.
230
00:22:42.710 --> 00:22:45.889
Coach: Yeah, in the next couple days, what would you…
231
00:22:46.270 --> 00:22:47.999
Coach: What can you take as a first step?
232
00:22:51.620 --> 00:22:58.620
Coachee: Yeah, finding… I think I'm gonna start looking for some
programs that can fit into my lifestyle.
233
00:22:58.820 --> 00:23:04.819
Coachee: That don't necessarily… like, maybe, like, an app or
something that…
234
00:23:04.950 --> 00:23:14.829
Coachee: Can help with, different exercises for… Me that can… Can work
with.
235
00:23:16.110 --> 00:23:17.130
Coachee: my day.
236
00:23:19.270 --> 00:23:20.090
Coachee: Yeah.
237
00:23:21.590 --> 00:23:25.940
Coach: Yeah, okay, so, well, thank you, Liz, for… for…
238
00:23:26.060 --> 00:23:38.260
Coach: for share this conversation with me, and it's quite inspiring
to hear different ideas come out. And just as we wrap up, I want to
know, ask you, what has stood out in today's meeting?
239
00:23:44.690 --> 00:23:47.330
Coachee: like, the stories I tell myself.
240
00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:52.700
Coachee: And realizing the excuses that I make.
241
00:23:54.020 --> 00:24:04.080
Coachee: that hold me back from doing something, whereas if I stopped,
like, the time that I take to make the excuse, I could be doing
something else, like…
242
00:24:04.190 --> 00:24:08.690
Coachee: productive to… implement a change.
243
00:24:09.140 --> 00:24:11.489
Coachee: So I think that that's encouraging, is…
244
00:24:11.900 --> 00:24:18.890
Coachee: just recognizing when that happens, and what can I do to
override that, or change that pattern.
245
00:24:21.470 --> 00:24:25.610
Coach: What could be something you can think of that, if you felt like
you don't want to do.
246
00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:27.829
Coach: The exercise you want to do.
247
00:24:29.490 --> 00:24:39.979
Coachee: There's some reminder, it could be… Yeah, I think… Maybe
having,
248
00:24:40.230 --> 00:24:50.009
Coachee: Matt, like, hold me accountable. At the end of the day,
asking me, kind of, like, oh, you know, you've set the goal of doing…
249
00:24:50.860 --> 00:24:58.560
Coachee: 10 minutes a day of… of strength training. You know, what
have you done today?
250
00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:04.010
Coachee: And if I haven't, then… You know, before I can…
251
00:25:04.860 --> 00:25:08.489
Coachee: watch TV, or something like that, like, I just do that.
252
00:25:10.820 --> 00:25:12.970
Coachee: Unless I'm sick or something, but…
253
00:25:13.690 --> 00:25:14.500
Coach: Yeah.
254
00:25:14.740 --> 00:25:16.700
Coach: Matt, Matt can help you.
255
00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:17.840
Coachee: Yeah.
256
00:25:18.350 --> 00:25:19.420
Coach: Hold you accountable.
257
00:25:19.830 --> 00:25:21.099
Coachee: Yeah, he's good like that.
258
00:25:23.260 --> 00:25:24.660
Coach: Right? Okay.
259
00:25:24.770 --> 00:25:27.150
Coach: Alright, thank you so much, Liz.
260
00:25:27.150 --> 00:25:28.860

Coachee: Of course, my pleasure. Thank you.
263
00:25:33.870 --> 00:25:35.059
Coachee: Let me just grab my pen.
